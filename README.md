# Panther Path

A 3D isometric arcade game inspired by Crossy Road, built with Three.js. Navigate a stylized panther across dangerous roads and logs.

## How to Play

2. **Objective:** Cross as many lanes as possible without getting hit by cars or falling into the water.
3. **Logs:** You can stay on logs in the river to stay afloat.
